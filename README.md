# N-body_builder
This repository presents a set of Python utilities to create a tailored to realistic pure N-body model. The tools used here are the 2D photometric tool Imfit and the N-body modelling architecture AGAMA, respectively. Both codes can be consult on their respective papers as follows:

- 2D photometric tool Imfit: Erwin 2015.

- AGAMA galaxy model architecture: Vasiliev 2019.

All the necessary data to initialise and run the scripts are attached in folder 'data'.
